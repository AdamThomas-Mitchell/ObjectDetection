### Development Notes ###


## Project Plan ## 

The goal of this project is to finetune the pre-trained YOLO model on the FLIR dataset. In doing so, I will gain an understanding of basic computer vision practices. Additionally, this project will utilise Weights&Biases, ActiveLoop DeepLake, and AWS cloud computing. The data should be stored on an AWS server and DeepLake should be used to process and access the data. AWS should also be used to train the models. Several versions of the YOLO model will be trained and experiments will be tracked and compared using W&B.

Currently, my understanding of computer vision is pretty much zero. First step is to consume as much information as possible regarding the YOLO models, object detection, and computer vision in general. On hte first pass, there is likely going to be a lot of information that doesn't make sense but that's alright and it's to be expected. I'll take note of some of the more important/influential papers and try and understand them in depth. In doing so, I will hopefully develop a reasonable idea of the landscape of computer vision.

Very useful overview.

List of papers to read:
- You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection (https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Redmon_You_Only_Look_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)
- YOLOv2
- YOLOv3
- YOLOv4
- scaled-YOLOv4
- YOLOR
- YOLOX
- YOLOv7
- YOLOv6
- From YOLOv1 to YOLOv8 and YOLO-NAS

Also, this seems to be a useful list of important papers in CV: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/top-10-must-read-papers-computer-vision-debiprasad-bandopadhyay/
